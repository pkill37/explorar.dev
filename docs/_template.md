### The Mental Model

Explain the concept first. Avoid turning the chapter into a file inventory.

### Where It Lives

Use repository-relative paths. Link important files like [the entry point](path/to/entry-file.c).

```chapter-graph
path/to/entry-file.c -> path/to/helper.c : delegates work
path/to/helper.c -> path/to/public-api.h : uses shared definitions
```
